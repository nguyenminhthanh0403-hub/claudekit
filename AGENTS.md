# Bullion Mk1 — US Financial System Interactive Map

## Project Overview

This project builds a comprehensive interactive map of the US financial system as a personal learning and teaching tool. The map is a single HTML file (`financial-map.html`) using D3.js v7.

**Current state**: `financial-map.html` — force-directed network, dark gold theme, Beginner/Expert toggle, shock simulations, AI narrative via Codex API.

**Target**: ~100 nodes across all major US financial system layers (monetary policy, fiscal, regulators, commercial banking, shadow banking, markets, FX/commodities, infrastructure, geopolitics).

## Agent Pipeline: Planner → Builder → Tester

Every content addition session follows this exact flow:

```
finance-planner → finance-builder → finance-tester
      ↓                  ↓                ↓
  Plan nodes          Implement         Validate
  Plan links          Edit HTML         Report FAILs
  Output JSON         Verify JS         → back to builder
```

### Step 1: Invoke `finance-planner`
Use when: deciding what nodes to add next, or when you need structured node/link specs.

Skills available:
- `/plan-nodes` — apply the 4-question framework to a list of institutions
- `/plan-connections` — map transmission mechanisms between nodes

Output: JSON-formatted node specs + link specs ready for the builder.

### Step 2: Invoke `finance-builder`
Use when: implementing planned nodes/links into `financial-map.html`.

Skills available:
- `/add-d3-layer` — add a new group to GROUP_COLOR + LAYER_LABELS + GROUP_DEPTH
- `/add-d3-node` — append nodes and links to the NODES/LINKS arrays

Rules:
- Always add a new layer BEFORE adding nodes that use it
- Never modify existing 20 nodes or 46 original links
- Always verify no duplicate IDs before and after editing

### Step 3: Invoke `finance-tester`
Use when: after every builder session, before reporting completion.

Skills available:
- `/validate-plan` — cross-check implementation against the plan
- `/test-ui` — verify code features (API key, edge toggle, breaks panel)

Output: PASS/FAIL/WARNING report. FAILs go back to builder. WARNINGs are reported to user.

## Content Standards (enforced by finance-planner)

Every node MUST have:
- `beginner`: plain English, 1–2 sentences, analogy optional
- `expert`: technical explanation with at least one cited data source
- `breaks`: specific failure cascade — what concretely fails if this node is removed

Every link MUST have:
- `w` (1/2/3): transmission strength
- `sign` (+1/-1/0): direction when source rises
- `why`: the mechanism, not the correlation

---

## Background: User Context

- Business student, beginner finance level, strong accounting basics
- Goal: personal learning + future teaching use
- Explain the WHY behind structures
- End complex topics with a TLDR
- Back stats with sources (FRED, BLS, Fed, BIS, WGC, IIF, WTO)
- Be critical — flag flawed categorizations before mistakes are made
